Ship 84 has three vessels.  Our flagship is a 40-foot sailboat called The Resolution.  We also have a 34-foot Swedish-made sailboat called The Kolga.  Finally, we have a small fishing boat called The Mako.

The Resolution is a Hinckley Bermuda 40 yawl sailboat.  The Resolution will not be in the water for the 2020 season while we perform restoration work such as sealing the teak wood, repainting the deck, and replacing the head.  She will return to service in 2021.
